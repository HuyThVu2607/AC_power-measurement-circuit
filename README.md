# AC Power Measurement Circuit

This is a project for measuring AC power using STM32.

## Purpose

This project is created to design and develop a simple and effective AC power measurement circuit using ESP32 and common electronic components.

## Key Features

- Measure and display AC power
- Transmit measured data via UART
- Display measured data on an ST7735 display

## Requirements

- STM32 (or compatible board) (In this project we use stm32f303c8t6 microprocessor )
- AC power sensor
- Other necessary electronic components

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in Keil C.
3. Configure pin connections according to the code.
4. Compile and upload the program to STM32.
5. Read the measured data from UART.

## Updates

The project is still under development. New updates will be added regularly.

## Contribution

All contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please create an issue or send a pull request.
